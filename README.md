# -Remaining-Range-Prediction-for-Electric-Vehicle-Using-Machine-Learning
Electric vehicles are one of the most rapidly growing technologies in the modern world. However, a major issue with electric vehicles is their limited driving range. The limited driving range of electric vehicles often causes anxiety among drivers about the distance these vehicles can cover. Despite various technological developments, accurately predicting the remaining range of electric vehicles remains a significant challenge. In this paper, a machine learning model is proposed to predict the range of electric vehicles based on real-world data. The system utilizes a Linear Regression model in conjunction with Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression models for the prediction of electric vehicle ranges. The system is trained to learn the relationship between driving distance and the various features of electric vehicles in real-world scenarios.
